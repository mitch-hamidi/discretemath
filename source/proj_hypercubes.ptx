  <li><p>
  Think about the square that has corners at <m>(0,1), (1,1), (1,0), (0,0)</m> in the plane <m>\mathbb {R}^2</m>. Draw a picture of it and label the corners. 
</p>
</li>
  <li><p>
  The corners of this square are actually <m>\mathbb {Z}_2\times \mathbb {Z}_2</m>! Holy cow! What is <m>(0,1)+(1,0)</m>? 
</p>
</li>
  <li><p>
  Write out the operation table of this square. 
</p>
</li>
  <li><p>
  Draw a picture of the square again, highlight two of its corners, and then highlight the corner that they add up to. Do this a couple of times with different corners. Do you notice a pattern? 
</p>
</li>

  Now think about the cube that has corners at <m>(0,1,0), (1,1,0), (1,0,0), (0,0,0), (0,1,1),</m> <m>(1,1,1), (1,0,1), (0,0,1)</m>. Draw a picture of it and label the corners.

  Write out the operation table of this cube.

  You can make a cube in four dimensions as <m>\mathbb {Z}_2^4</m>. What is <m>(0,1,0,1)+(1,0,1,1)</m>? 
</p>
</li>
  <li><p>
  When the dimensions get to four or higher, it's called a <m>n</m>-dimensional hypercube. Watch the 42-year-old video here <url href="https://youtu.be/90olwwLdEYg" /> to get a good explanation of the geometry of it, plus a history lesson about what CGI used to be like.

  <li><p>
  Do you feel like you can visualize a <m>4</m>-dimensional hypercube in your head now? What about <m>5</m>-dimensional?
