We would like to find all zeros of <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> and the smallest field, call it <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> for now, that contains them. The zeros are <span class="process-math">\(x= \pm \sqrt{2}\text{,}\)</span> neither of which is an element of <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Q}\text{.}\)</span> The set <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> we are looking for must satisfy the conditions:</div>

<div xmlns:pf="https://prefigure.org" class="para">By the last condition  <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{2}\)</span> must be an element of <span class="process-math">\(S\text{,}\)</span> and, if <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> is to be a field, the sum, product, difference, and quotient of elements in <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> must be in <span class="process-math">\(S\text{.}\)</span> So operations involving this number, such as  <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{2}\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\left(\sqrt{2}\right)^2\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\left(\sqrt{2}\right)^3\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{2}+\sqrt{2}\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{2}-\sqrt{2}\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\)</span>  must all be elements of <span class="process-math">\(S\text{.}\)</span>   Further, since <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> contains <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Q}\)</span> as a subset, any element of <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Q}\)</span> combined with <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{2}\)</span> under any field operation must be an element of <span class="process-math">\(S\text{.}\)</span> Hence, every element of the form <span class="process-math">\(a + b \sqrt{2}\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> can be any elements in <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Q}\text{,}\)</span> is an element of <span class="process-math">\(S\text{.}\)</span> We leave to the reader to show that <span class="process-math">\(S =\{a + b \sqrt{2} \mid a, b \in \mathbb{Q}\}\)</span> is a field (see Exercise 1 of this section). We note that the second zero of <span class="process-math">\(x^2 - 2\text{,}\)</span> namely  <span class="process-math">\(-\sqrt{2}\text{,}\)</span> is an element of this set. To see this, simply take <span class="process-math">\(a = 0\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b = -1\text{.}\)</span> The field <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> is frequently denoted as <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Q}\left(\sqrt{2}\right)\text{,}\)</span> and it is referred to as an extension field of <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Q}\text{.}\)</span>  Note that the polynomial <span class="process-math">\(x^2-2=\left(x-\sqrt{2}\right)\left(x+\sqrt{2}\right)\)</span> factors into linear factors, or <dfn class="terminology">splits</dfn>, in <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Q}\left(\sqrt{2}\right)[x]\text{;}\)</span> that is, all coefficients of both factors are elements of the field <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Q}\left(\sqrt{2}\right)\text{.}\)</span>
