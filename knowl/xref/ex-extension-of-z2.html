<div class="para">Consider the polynomial <span class="process-math">\(g(x) = x^2 + x + 1 \in  \mathbb{Z}_2[x]\text{.}\)</span> Let’s repeat  the steps from the previous example to factor <span class="process-math">\(g(x)\text{.}\)</span> First, <span class="process-math">\(g(0) = 1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(g(1) = 1\text{,}\)</span> so none of the elements of <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z}_2\)</span> are zeros of <span class="process-math">\(g(x)\text{.}\)</span> Hence, the zeros of <span class="process-math">\(g(x)\)</span> must lie in an extension field of <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z}_2\text{.}\)</span> By <a href="s-polynomial-rings.html#theorem-max-zeros" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/theorem-max-zeros.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Theorem 16.3.15">Theorem 16.3.15</a>, <span class="process-math">\(g(x) = x^2 + x + 1\)</span> can have at most two zeros. Let <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> be a zero of <span class="process-math">\(g(x)\text{.}\)</span> Then the extension field <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> of <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z}_2\)</span> must contain, besides <span class="process-math">\(a\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(a \cdot a = a^2\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(a^3\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(a + a\text{,}\)</span>  <span class="process-math">\(a+1\text{,}\)</span> and so on. But, since <span class="process-math">\(g(a) = 0\text{,}\)</span> we have <span class="process-math">\(a^2 + a + 1 = 0\text{,}\)</span> or equivalently, <span class="process-math">\(a^2= -(a+1)=a+1\)</span> (remember, we are working in an extension of <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z}_2\)</span>). We can use this recurrence relation to reduce powers of <span class="process-math">\(a\text{.}\)</span> So far our extension field, <span class="process-math">\(S\text{,}\)</span> of <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z}_2\)</span> must contain the set <span class="process-math">\(\{0, 1, a, a + 1\}\text{,}\)</span> and we claim that this the complete extension. For <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> to be a field, all possible sums, products, and differences of elements in <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> must be in <span class="process-math">\(S\text{.}\)</span> Let’s try a few:  <span class="process-math">\(a + a = a\left(1 +_2 1\right)=a\cdot 0=0\in S\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(a+a=0\text{,}\)</span>  <span class="process-math">\(-a = a\text{,}\)</span> which is in <span class="process-math">\(S\text{.}\)</span>  Adding three <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span>’s together doesn’t give us anything new: <span class="process-math">\(a + a + a = a\in
S\)</span>   In fact, <span class="process-math">\(n a\)</span> is in <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> for all possible positive integers <span class="process-math">\(n\text{.}\)</span>  Next,</div>
