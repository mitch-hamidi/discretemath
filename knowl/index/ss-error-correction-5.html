<div xmlns:pf="https://prefigure.org" class="para">The encoding that we will consider here takes a block <span class="process-math">\(a = \left(a_1, a_2, a_3 \right)\)</span> and produces a code word of length 6. As in the triple repetition code, each code word will differ from each other code word by at least three bits. As a result, any single error will not push a code word close enough to another code word to cause confusion. Now for the details.</div> <div xmlns:pf="https://prefigure.org" class="para logical">

</div> <div xmlns:pf="https://prefigure.org" class="para logical">
<div class="para">One way to see that any two distinct code words have a distance from one another of at least 3 is to consider the images of any two distinct messages.  If <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> are distinct elements of <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z}_2{}^3\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(c = a + b\)</span> has at least one coordinate equal to 1. Now consider the difference between <span class="process-math">\(e(a)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(e(b)\text{:}\)</span>

</div>
<div class="para">Whether <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span> has 1, 2, or 3 ones, <span class="process-math">\(e(c)\)</span> must have at least three ones.  This can be seen by considering the three cases separately.  For example, if <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span> has a single one, two of the parity bits are also 1.  Therefore, <span class="process-math">\(e(a)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(e(b)\)</span> differ in at least three bits. By the same logic as with triple repetition, a single bit error in any code word produces an element of the code space that is contained in on of the balls of radius 1 centered about a code word.</div>
</div> <div xmlns:pf="https://prefigure.org" class="para logical">
<div class="para">Now consider the problem of decoding received transmissions. Imagine that a code word, <span class="process-math">\(e(a)\text{,}\)</span> is transmitted, and <span class="process-math">\(b= \left(b_1, b_2, b_3,b_4, b_5, b_6\right)\)</span> is received.
